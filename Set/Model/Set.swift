 Four features:
 1. Symbols - "▲", "◼︎", and "✦".
 2. Numbers - one, two, or three symbols. "▲", "▲▲", and "▲▲▲"
 3. Shading - solid, striped, or open
 4. Color - red, green or purple
 
 Play:
 - Allows user to select 3 cards at a time.  Also allow user to deselect cards that are already selected, but only if there 2 or less cards selected.  Once user select 3 cards, a match/mismatch must be determined.
 - match cards (true/false) when user select 3 cards
 - deal cards, 3 at a time, that does one of the following:
 1. replace the selected cards if there's a match
 2. add 3 cards to the game
 
 Score:
 - Each match is 3 points
 - Each mismatch is -5 points
 - If user already selected a card, and user deselects a card, is - 1 point.
